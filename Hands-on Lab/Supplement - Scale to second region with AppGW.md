# Azure Resource Manager hands-on lab step-by-step - Scale to 2nd Region with Application Gateway

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a 2nd instance of the infrastructure from the 1st HOL to another region.  The 2nd instance will be configured to use an Application Gateway in place of a Load Balancer.  Finally, Traffic Manager will be used to route traffic between both instances.

-   How to deploy and configure an Application Gateway with VM Scale Sets.

-   How to deploy and configure Traffic Manager.


## Exercise 1: Create a 2nd instance of architecture in another region

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will configure the template to scale out to a 2nd region by deploying a 2nd instance of the architecture.  The 2nd instance will use an Application Gateway.

 > **Note:** Consider making a copy of the Visual Studio solution.

### Task 1: Add the Application Gateway

1. Before adding the Application Gateway, delete the Load Balancer. In the JSON Outline window, under resources, click on the Load Balancer and delete it.

![Delete the LB.](images/Scale-to-second-region/deletelb.png "delete")

   In the same window, under variables, delete the lbxxx variables.
   
![Delete the LB variables.](images/Scale-to-second-region/deletelbvariables.png "delete")

2. Add the following variables to the end of the **variables** section of the **azuredeploy.json** file:

    >**Note:** Do not forget to add the comma.
    
    ![Application Gateway variables.](images/Scale-to-second-region/appgwvariables.png "AppGW variables")

```
    "appGwName": "appGw",
    "appGwID": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways',variables('appGwName'))]",
    "appGwSubnetName": "appGwSubnet",
    "appGwSubnetPrefix": "10.0.2.0/24",
    "appGwSubnetID": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets','hackathonvnet', variables('appGwSubnetName'))]",
    "appGwFrontendPort": 80,
    "appGwBackendPort": 80,
    "appGwBePoolName": "appGwBepool",
    "appGwBePoolID": "[concat(variables('appGwID'), '/backendAddressPools/', variables('appGwBePoolName'))]"
```

3. Add the following JSON at the beginning of the JSON template as the first item under the **resources** node. 

![Add the Application Gateway.](images/Scale-to-second-region/image80.png "Add AppGW")

 > **Note:** This code creates an Application Gateway.

            }
          }
        ]
      }
    },
```

### Task 2: Update the VNet to provide a subnet for the application gateway

1. In the JSON outline window, click on hackathonVnet. Add the below after the last subnet:

    >**Note:** Do not forget to add the comma.
    
![Add the Application Gateway subnet.](images/Scale-to-second-region/appgwsubnet.png "Add AppGW subnet")

```
          {
            "name": "[variables('appGwSubnetName')]",
            "properties": {
              "addressPrefix": "[variables('appGwSubnetPrefix')]"
            }
          }
```

### Task 3: Update the VMSS resource to use the Application Gateway

1. In the JSON outline window, click on the VMSS object. Update the \"dependsOn\" section from:

![Add the Application Gateway subnet.](images/Scale-to-second-region/vmssdependson.png "Add AppGW subnet")

 To:

![Add the Application Gateway subnet.](images/Scale-to-second-region/vmssdependsonafter.png "Add AppGW subnet")


2. Scroll down to the networkProfile section. Replace \"loadBalancerBAckendAddressPools\" from: 

![Add the Application Gateway subnet.](images/Scale-to-second-region/vmsslbbepool.png "Add AppGW subnet")

 To:

![Add the Application Gateway subnet.](images/Scale-to-second-region/vmssappgwbepool.png "Add AppGW subnet")

```
    "ApplicationGatewayBackendAddressPools": [
        {
        "id": "[variables('appGwBePoolID')]"
        }
    ]
```

### Task 4

1. Create a **new deployment**, and choose a new **resource group**. Name the new resource group **ARMHackathonScaleSetRegion2**.

    ![In the Resource group field, ARMHackathonScaleSet (West US) displays.](images/Scale-to-second-region/resourcegroupname.png "Resource group field")

    > **Note:** Be sure to choose a different region for the location field.

2. Choose any of the template parameters files, and click **Edit Parameters**.

    ![In the Template parameters file field, deploymenttemplate.param.prod.json displays, along with an Edit Parameters button.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image97.png "Template parameters file field")

3. Provide a unique value for the **hackathonPublicIPDnsName**. Enter a value of **2** for the **instanceCount**. Click **Save** and **Deploy**.

    > **Note:** The **hackathonPublicIPDnsName** must be changed since it's already in use in the first deployment.

    ![In the Edit Parameters dialog box, the hackathonPublicIPDnsName, instanceCount, and newStorageAccountSuffix parameters are circled. The checkbox is selected and circled for Save passwords as plain text in the parameters file, and the Save buton is circled as well.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image98.png "Edit Parameters dialog box")

    > **Note:** The deployment may take 30 to 45 minutes to complete. If Visual Studio fails monitoring the solution with an error about the SAS Token expiring, you can open the resource group in the Portal, and you can monitor the deployment by clicking the link under the Last Deployment lab on the essentials pane.

4. Within the **Azure Management Portal**, open the **resource group**, and click the **hackathonPublicIP** resource.

    ![Screenshot of the HackathonPublicIP resource.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image99.png "HackathonPublicIP resource")

5. Copy the **DNS name**, and navigate to it in a browser to validate the load balancer and the scale set are working. Click **Refresh** several times, and the page should flip from WEBSET-0 to WEBSET-1.

    ![The Cloud Shop webpage displays, with a list of products from which to choose.](images/Hands-onlabstep-by-step-AzureResourceManagerimages/media/image100.png "Cloud Shop webpage")

## Exercise 2: Create Traffic Manager

1. In the Azure portal, click on **Create New Resource** and search for **Traffic Manager**.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/newresource.png "New Resource")

  Click on Traffic Manager Profile.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/searchforTM.png "New Resource")

  In the windows that opens, click on Create.
      
2. Create the Traffic Manager Profile with the following configuration:
  - Name: Must be unique
  - Routing Method: Weighted
  - Resource Group: (Create New) TrafficManager
  - Resource Group Location: East US

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/trafficmgrnew.png "New Resource")

3. Go to the Resource Group where Traffic Manager was created and click on the Traffic Manager resource.

4. In the Traffic Manager configuration, click on Endpoints.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/endpoints.png "New Resource")

5. Click on Add.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/add.png "New Resource")

6. Fill in the New Endpoint form with the appropriate information.  Do the same for the both endpoints / application instances.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/tmendpoints.png "New Resource")

7. Once the endpoints are added, click refresh until both endpoints show as Online.

  ![New Resource](images/Scale-to-second-region/tmstatus.png "New Resource")

8. Test that TM works by going to the Traffic Manager endpoint from 2 different workstations.
